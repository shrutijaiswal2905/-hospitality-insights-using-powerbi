## 📌 Project Overview

This repository showcases a complete end-to-end **hospitality revenue insights dashboard project using Power BI**, designed for a fictional five-star hotel chain operating across India. It covers the journey from raw data to business-ready insights to assist management in addressing competitive pressures.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Learn and apply **Power BI for data analytics and visualization**.
* Understand **key hospitality metrics** such as RevPAR, ADR, DSRN, Realisation, and Occupancy.
* Practice **data cleaning, transformation, and modeling** with a star schema approach.
* Build and design a professional, interactive dashboard for stakeholders.

## 🗂️ Dataset Details

Includes realistic data on:

* Hotel properties and locations.
* Room categories.
* Booking and occupancy data.
